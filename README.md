# Mission-To-Mars
If I plan out an entire mission to Mars, I'll either get a job at NASA, or just get really good at math. Either works.

Very open to complaints about the math used. I have algebra 1 and nothing else as of this update. And I basically just learned all of the other math by googling and stuff.

Also it just runs on typing in the terminal but that's gonna be changed soon

Future Addition To-Do

= Add java swing into this so it looks clean

= Add more customization on rocket components after implementing into an actual good looking UI
